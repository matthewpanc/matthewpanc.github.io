        <header><u>Basic terminology:</u></header>
        <p>
          Variable : something that can store one piece of data and then be changed to store a different piece of data
          <br>
          Boolean : variable with a true or false value
          <br>
          List : a list of values with a corresponding index
          <br>
          Index: a number that corresponds to a specific location in a list
          <br>
          Loop : a sequence of instructions that are repeated until some condition is met
          <br>
          Function: A section of a program that can be called later on that returns a value
          <br>
          Key: In a sorting algorithm the value being used to compare to other values

        <header><u>What are algorithms? What are sorting algorithms?</u></header>
        <p>
          Algoriths are a sequence of steps followed inorder to complete a given task. For example you could make an algorithm to make toast. Some steps in that algorithm may be to get your loaf of bread, if it is in a bag open it, if it is not already in slides grab a knife, and so on until you have a complete algorithm for making toast.
          Sorting algorithms are a type of algorithm used to sort data based on some value.

        <header><u>Why are sorting algorithms used and why are they useful?</u></header>
        <p>            
          Sorting algorithms are used whenever a computer needs to sort items. For example if you search up anything on google, part of what google does is sort your pages based off of values they are assigned inorder to give you the best recommended pages. Sorting algorithms are used for tasks like this everywhere on websites like amazon, youtube, instagram, excetera.

        <header><u>What are some sorting algorithms and what is the difference between them?</u></header>
        <p>          
          Some types of algorithms are selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, insertion sort, etc. The difference between them is the algorithms (set of steps) that they use, and the resulting time complexity (essentially speed). An algorithms time complexity is basically the number of times you need to iterate through the algorithm before it finishes. This can be shown using big O notation. Big O notation shows the greatest possible number of iterations that the algorithm can go through before completing as the input size grows. For example, if you wrote an algorithm that only did the calculation 1 + 1 it would have a speed of O(1) as it will always only take one iteration to get through the entire algorithm. Contrastly if you were to loop through a set of random values and check to see if any equal 10 the speed would be O(N), where N is the number of values. This is because in the worst case scenario the algorithm would take N steps to complete (one loop through every value): it could take 5 or 10 or N-1 steps, but in the worst case it would take N steps.
